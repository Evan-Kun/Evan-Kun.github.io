Professional Profile
======
Final‑year **Ph.D. candidate in Machine Learning & Data Science** (University of Queensland, expected 2025) who thrives at the intersection of research and production. I design **trustworthy, interpretable time‑series models** and turn them into robust, cloud‑native services. Highlights include a **90 % boost in metadata‑extraction efficiency** for engineering drawings and end‑to‑end MLOps pipelines on hardened AWS infrastructure. I value clean code, reproducible science, and security‑first engineering.
