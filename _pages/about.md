I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Machine Learning and Data Science, passionate about building intelligent and efficient solutions with real-world impact. My work involves developing AI-powered systems, such as the one I created for engineering drawings (Panelo), which achieves a 90% increase in metadata extraction efficiency. I'm also experienced in building secure web platforms and automating processes to streamline workflows.

My research focuses on trustworthy AI, specifically robust and interpretable time series analysis. I have a strong background in deep learning, with expertise in transformer networks, graph neural networks, and attention mechanisms. I'm committed to developing robust and reliable solutions for real-world applications.
