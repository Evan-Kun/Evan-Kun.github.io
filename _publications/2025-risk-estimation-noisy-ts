excerpt: |
  We introduce a principled risk-estimation framework for mining **irregular time-series data with noisy labels**. By modelling per-instance noise and calibrating risk bounds, our method delivers robust classification while providing uncertainty estimates that aid downstream decision-making.

Label noise and irregular sampling often co-occur in real-world sensor and log streams, degrading model reliability.  
Our proposed **Noise-Aware Risk Estimation (NARE)** framework:

* **Models timestamp-level noise** via a Beta-Bernoulli prior, enabling adaptive confidence weighting.  
* **Derives a closed-form risk estimator** that upper-bounds the true empirical risk under irregular sampling.  
* **Incorporates a co-teaching curriculum** that gradually filters high-risk instances during training.

On three public IoT and healthcare benchmarks, NARE improves macro-F1 by up to **8 pp** over state-of-the-art robust TSC baselines, while offering calibrated uncertainty scores for critical-event detection.
