Deep models often trade interpretability for accuracy—especially on multivariate, irregular time-series data.  
**HITS** (Hierarchical Interpretable Time Series) bridges this gap by:

* **Variable-level MIL attention** to spotlight the most informative sensors or channels.  
* **Patch-level temporal pooling** that captures long-range dependencies without over-segmenting data.  
* An **information-bottleneck regulariser** ensuring concise, human-interpretable saliency maps.

Across 12 healthcare and IoT datasets, HITS matches or exceeds the performance of leading baselines (TimeMIL, PatchTST) while reducing explanation entropy by **32 %**, making insights clearer for domain experts.
